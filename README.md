Law of Large Numbers Simulation

Overview

This project demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers using Python to simulate random normally distributed numbers. The objective is to verify that the proportion of numbers falling within a specified range approaches a theoretical probability as the sample size increases.

Task Description

The task involves creating a Python script that:
1.	Generates a large sample of random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
2.	Counts how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1.
3.	Calculates the proportion of these numbers relative to the total sample size N.
4.	Confirms that the calculated mean approaches the expected mean E(X)=68.2% as N increases.

Key Learnings

1.	Law of Large Numbers: This project illustrates how, as the sample size NNN increases, the calculated proportion of random values that fall within a specific range converges to the theoretical probability. This validates the Law of Large Numbers.
2.	Statistical Concepts: Gained insights into normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule), which states that approximately 68% of values lie within one standard deviation from the mean in a normal distribution.
3.	Python and NumPy: Improved proficiency in using Python for statistical simulations, specifically leveraging the NumPy library to generate random numbers efficiently.
4.	Iterative Testing: Learned the importance of increasing sample size and observing the effects on calculated statistics, which reinforces statistical concepts in a practical context.
5.	Coding Practice: Enhanced coding skills through the implementation of loops, conditionals, and basic statistical calculations.

Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the Law of Large Numbers and reinforces key statistical principles. It serves as a valuable exercise in using Python for data analysis and simulation.
